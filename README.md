# MyReads Project

This is done using the starter template for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course.

# Running the website

```bash
npm install
npm start # Will open browser on localhost:3000
```

The project was built using types and tsserver to help durning dev.

I migrated it from js to tsx as well, (After passing) I added some error handling to try out a new techinque.

Here is project run.
